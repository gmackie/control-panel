# Node Health Monitoring Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. Health Monitor Module
- **HealthMonitor** (`src/lib/cluster/modules/health-monitor.ts`)
  - Collects real-time metrics from all nodes
  - Monitors CPU, memory, disk, and network conditions
  - Manages alerts with automatic resolution
  - Stores historical metrics for analysis
  - Emits events for real-time updates

### 2. Health Dashboard UI
- **HealthDashboard** (`src/components/cluster/HealthDashboard.tsx`)
  - Cluster health overview with node counts
  - Active alerts display with severity levels
  - Individual node status cards with resource meters
  - Real-time updates via Server-Sent Events
  - Color-coded health indicators

### 3. API Endpoints
- `/api/cluster/health` - Health status and alerts
- `/api/cluster/health/stream` - Real-time SSE stream for live updates

### 4. Integration
- Added to ClusterOrchestrator as a core module
- New "Health" tab in cluster management page
- Works alongside autoscaling for comprehensive monitoring

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Monitoring**
   - Updates every 30 seconds
   - Live dashboard with SSE streaming
   - Instant alert notifications

2. **Comprehensive Metrics**
   - CPU, Memory, Pod utilization
   - Node conditions (disk/memory pressure, network)
   - System information tracking

3. **Alert System**
   - Configurable thresholds
   - Automatic resolution when issues clear
   - Multiple severity levels (warning/critical)

4. **Visual Health Status**
   - Progress bars for resource usage
   - Color-coded status badges
   - Alert timeline with age indicators

## Architecture Highlights

The health monitoring system follows the modular architecture:
- Extends BaseClusterModule interface
- Integrates with KubeconfigManager for kubectl access
- Uses EventEmitter for real-time updates
- Maintains internal state for metrics history

## Configuration

Default thresholds are set for:
- CPU: 70% warning, 90% critical
- Memory: 80% warning, 95% critical
- Disk: 80% warning, 90% critical
- Heartbeat: 60s warning, 120s critical

## Usage

1. Navigate to Cluster page
2. Click "Health" tab
3. Monitor real-time node health
4. Respond to alerts as needed

## Benefits

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Detect issues before they impact services
- **Resource Optimization**: Identify underutilized or overloaded nodes
- **Operational Visibility**: Complete view of cluster health
- **Automated Alerts**: No manual checking required
- **Historical Analysis**: Track trends over time

## Next Steps

1. Deploy metrics-server to k3s cluster for accurate data
2. Configure alert thresholds based on workload
3. Set up external notifications (email/Slack)
4. Use health data to optimize autoscaling policies
5. Create runbooks for common alert scenarios

The health monitoring system provides essential visibility into cluster operations, enabling proactive management and rapid issue resolution.
