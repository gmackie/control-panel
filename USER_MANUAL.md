## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How do I get access to the control panel?**
A: Contact your system administrator to add your GitHub account to the authorized users list.

**Q: Can I use this on mobile devices?**
A: Yes, the control panel is fully responsive and works on tablets and smartphones.

**Q: How often is data updated?**
A: Most metrics are updated every 30 seconds. Real-time data uses server-sent events for instant updates.

### Applications

**Q: How do I deploy a new application?**
A: Use the Applications section to create new deployments. You'll need the Git repository URL and container image location.

**Q: Can I rollback a deployment?**
A: Yes, go to the application details and use the deployment history to rollback to a previous version.

**Q: Why is my application showing as unhealthy?**
A: Check the application logs and health check configuration. Ensure the health endpoint is responding correctly.

### Monitoring

**Q: How do I create custom alerts?**
A: Navigate to Monitoring ‚Üí Alert Rules and create new rules using PromQL queries.

**Q: Why am I not receiving alert notifications?**
A: Verify your notification channels are configured correctly and test the connections.

**Q: Can I export metrics data?**
A: Yes, use the export functionality in the monitoring dashboard or access the API directly.

### Cluster Management

**Q: Is it safe to drain a node?**
A: Yes, draining gracefully moves pods to other nodes. However, ensure you have sufficient capacity on other nodes.

**Q: How do I add new nodes to the cluster?**
A: New nodes are added through the infrastructure provisioning process. Contact your administrator.

**Q: What happens if a master node fails?**
A: In a high-availability setup, other master nodes will maintain cluster operations. Single-master clusters require immediate attention.

### Integrations

**Q: How do I connect to a private Git repository?**
A: Configure SSH keys or access tokens in the integration settings. Ensure the service account has repository access.

**Q: Why are webhooks not working?**
A: Check the webhook URL, authentication, and payload format. Review webhook delivery logs in your Git service.

**Q: Can I use different container registries?**
A: Yes, configure multiple registry integrations in the settings. Each application can use different registries.

### Troubleshooting

**Q: The dashboard is loading slowly. What should I do?**
A: Check your internet connection, clear browser cache, and verify that backend services are running normally.

**Q: I'm getting permission errors. How do I fix this?**
A: Contact your administrator to verify your user permissions and role assignments.

**Q: How do I report a bug?**
A: Create an issue in the GitHub repository with detailed steps to reproduce the problem.
