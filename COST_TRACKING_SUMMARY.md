# Cost Tracking and Optimization Implementation Summary

## What Was Added

### 1. Cost Tracker Module
- **CostTracker** (`src/lib/cluster/modules/cost-tracker.ts`)
  - Collects costs from Hetzner Cloud API
  - Tracks servers, volumes, snapshots, load balancers, floating IPs
  - Calculates hourly, daily, monthly, and projected costs
  - Provides optimization recommendations
  - Stores historical data for trend analysis

### 2. Cost Dashboard UI
- **CostDashboard** (`src/components/cluster/CostDashboard.tsx`)
  - Cost overview with current and projected expenses
  - Interactive time range selection (7/30/90 days)
  - Visual charts:
    - Cost trends line chart
    - Resource breakdown pie chart
    - Top spenders list
  - Optimization recommendations with savings potential
  - Detailed resource tables

### 3. API Endpoint
- `/api/cluster/costs` - Returns cost data with optional optimizations

### 4. Integration
- Added to ClusterOrchestrator as a module
- New "Costs" tab in cluster management page
- Real-time cost tracking with 5-minute intervals

## Key Features

1. **Comprehensive Cost Tracking**
   - Server runtime and costs
   - Storage volumes and snapshots
   - Load balancers and floating IPs
   - Traffic overage calculations

2. **Cost Visualization**
   - Trend analysis with historical data
   - Resource breakdown by type
   - Change indicators (increases/decreases)
   - Currency formatting (EUR)

3. **Optimization Engine**
   - Identifies idle servers
   - Detects old snapshots
   - Finds unattached volumes
   - Calculates potential savings

4. **Alert System**
   - Daily cost threshold alerts
   - Monthly budget warnings
   - Unusual spike detection

## Architecture

The cost tracking system follows the modular architecture:
- Extends ClusterModule interface
- Uses Hetzner Cloud API for pricing data
- Maintains cost history in memory and database
- Provides real-time and historical insights

## Configuration

Default settings:
- Check interval: 5 minutes
- History retention: 30 days
- Alert thresholds:
  - Daily: €10
  - Monthly: €200
  - Spike: 50% increase

## Pricing Information

Hetzner Cloud pricing used:
- Servers: Variable by type
- Volumes: €0.0476/GB/month
- Snapshots: €0.0104/GB/month
- Floating IPs: €1.19/month
- Traffic: €1/TB (after included allowance)

## Usage

1. Navigate to Cluster page
2. Click "Costs" tab
3. View current expenses and trends
4. Review optimization recommendations
5. Act on savings opportunities

## Benefits

- **Cost Visibility**: Real-time view of infrastructure expenses
- **Budget Control**: Alerts before overspending
- **Optimization**: Identify and eliminate waste
- **Trend Analysis**: Understand cost patterns
- **Predictive Insights**: Project future expenses

## Next Steps

1. Set up database schema for persistent storage
2. Configure alert notifications
3. Add cost allocation tags
4. Implement cost budgets and limits
5. Create automated optimization actions
6. Add multi-currency support
7. Export cost reports

The cost tracking system provides essential financial visibility for infrastructure management, enabling informed decisions about resource allocation and optimization.
