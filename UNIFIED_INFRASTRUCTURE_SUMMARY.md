# Unified Infrastructure Management Implementation Summary

## Overview
The control panel has been extended to manage both K3s clusters and standalone Gitea VPS instances, providing a unified view of applications across different infrastructure types with tight integration for Git info, CI/CD workflows, and container registries.

## What Was Added

### 1. Infrastructure Management Layer

#### **InfrastructureManager** (`src/lib/infrastructure/manager.ts`)
- Unified manager for both K3s clusters and Gitea VPS instances
- Provisions and manages infrastructure lifecycle
- Aggregates applications across all infrastructure types
- Provides unified application view with deployments

#### **GiteaManager** (`src/lib/infrastructure/gitea-manager.ts`)
- Manages Gitea VPS provisioning on Hetzner
- Handles Docker Compose deployment
- Configures Nginx with SSL
- Monitors service health and resources
- Supports backup and updates

#### **GiteaClient** (`src/lib/gitea/client.ts`)
- Complete Gitea API client implementation
- Repository management
- Actions/Workflows monitoring
- Secrets management
- Webhooks configuration
- Pull requests and branches

### 2. Type Definitions (`src/lib/infrastructure/types.ts`)

#### **Infrastructure Types**
- `Infrastructure`: Base infrastructure definition
- `K3sInfraConfig`: K3s cluster configuration
- `GiteaVPSInfraConfig`: Gitea VPS configuration
- `UnifiedApplication`: Application with cross-infrastructure deployments
- `ApplicationDeployment`: Deployment details including Git, CI/CD, and registry info

### 3. UI Components

#### **InfrastructureSwitcher** (`src/components/infrastructure/InfrastructureSwitcher.tsx`)
- Visual infrastructure selector
- Quick switcher dropdown
- Infrastructure cards with status and costs
- Create new infrastructure option

#### **UnifiedApplicationView** (`src/components/applications/UnifiedApplicationView.tsx`)
- Comprehensive application dashboard
- Multiple deployment support across infrastructures
- Tabbed interface:
  - Overview: Status, version, infrastructure, costs
  - Git & CI/CD: Repository info, workflow runs, commit history
  - Registry: Container images, security scans
  - Runtime: Resource usage, scaling controls
  - Monitoring: Metrics, alerts, dashboards

### 4. API Routes
- `/api/infrastructure` - List and create infrastructures
- `/api/infrastructure/[id]` - Get and delete specific infrastructure
- `/api/applications/[id]/unified` - Get unified application view

### 5. Infrastructure Page (`src/app/infrastructure/page.tsx`)
- Central infrastructure management hub
- Infrastructure switching and overview
- Tabbed interface for detailed management
- Quick actions and navigation

## Key Features

### 1. **Unified Application Management**
- Single view for applications across K3s and Gitea
- Multiple deployment tracking
- Cross-infrastructure deployment status

### 2. **Comprehensive Integration**
- **Git Integration**: Repository info, branches, commits
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Gitea Actions monitoring, logs, reruns
- **Registry Info**: Harbor/Gitea registry with vulnerability scanning
- **Runtime Metrics**: CPU, memory, storage usage
- **Cost Tracking**: Per-application and infrastructure costs

### 3. **Infrastructure Flexibility**
- Support for multiple K3s clusters
- Multiple Gitea VPS instances
- Easy switching between infrastructures
- Consistent management interface

### 4. **Deployment Information**
- Git commit tracking
- CI/CD pipeline status
- Container image details
- Runtime resource usage
- Environment management

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Abstraction Layer**: Infrastructure details abstracted behind unified interface
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new infrastructure types
3. **Consistency**: Same UI/UX for different infrastructure types
4. **Integration**: Deep integration with Git, CI/CD, and registries
5. **Scalability**: Supports multiple infrastructures and applications

## Usage Flow

1. **Infrastructure Selection**
   - View all infrastructures in one place
   - Quick switch between K3s and Gitea
   - See status, resources, and costs

2. **Application Management**
   - View applications with their deployments
   - See which infrastructure hosts each deployment
   - Track Git commits, CI/CD runs, and container images

3. **Deployment Monitoring**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Resource usage tracking
   - Cost monitoring
   - Security scanning results

4. **Actions**
   - Redeploy applications
   - Scale resources
   - View logs
   - Manage secrets

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Gitea Actions Integration**
   - Real-time workflow monitoring
   - Log streaming
   - Artifact management

2. **Harbor Registry Integration**
   - Full registry management
   - Image scanning results
   - Retention policies

3. **Deployment Pipeline**
   - Unified deployment across infrastructures
   - GitOps integration
   - Rollback capabilities

4. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Metrics aggregation
   - Custom dashboards
   - Alert management

5. **Cost Optimization**
   - Infrastructure comparison
   - Recommendation engine
   - Budget alerts

This implementation provides a solid foundation for managing hybrid infrastructure (K3s + Gitea VPS) with deep integration for modern DevOps workflows.
